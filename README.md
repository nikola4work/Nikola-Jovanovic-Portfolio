## Description


I have created web page to showcase my future work using bootstrap as a framework. 
Pages contain a header with navigation links and my name.

* About me page -> It contains an image with a small paragraph about me.

* Contact page -> it contains forms with the user's name, email, and message. 
As well as sign up form for feature promotions.(Forms are not functional yet)

* Portfolio page -> It contains placeholder images(future projects) with project descriptions. Social Media button 



## Features

* I have created 3 separate HTML pages and CSS linked together for different styling. I wanted each page to have its background image, different styling.

* I was using Bootstrap as a framework to achive a more responsive website layout for all screen sizes. 

* Most of the styling was done through CSS . 

##### Some cool features-worth mentioning:

* Animation to make my name move left and right.
* Profile image shakes on mouse hover.
* CSS for box shadow-text shadow for (image, navigation links,etc).
* Google fonts .
* Work showcase -> image enlarge once you hover over them.
* Font awesome for social media icons.
